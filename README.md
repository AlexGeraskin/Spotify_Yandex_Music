## API vs Selenium + requests

For various reasons, I chose not to use the Spotify/Yandex API directly. Instead, Selenium is utilized for parsing Spotify web pages and well-configured HTTP requests are used for parsing Yandex Music. This approach enables anyone to use this app without the need for specific API keys.

However, one drawback of this approach is that any changes to the Spotify website may require updating specific XPATH values to maintain the functionality of the Selenium parsing.

You can find the code for parsing Spotify using Selenium in `spotify_link.py` and for parsing Yandex Music using requests in `yandexmusic_link.py`.

## Installation and Usage

To install this app, clone this repo, create Python venv and install the required packages. You can use either `requirements-base.txt` for essential libraries or `requirements.txt` for all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to obtain cookies for your requests to Yandex Music. You may also find `about_cookies.py` and `.sample_env` useful for that.

If you want to use this app as a Telegram bot, obtain a Telegram bot token, store it in the `.env` file, and then run `tgbot.py`. Alternatively, you can use `spotify_link.py` or `yandexmusic_link.py` for your specific tasks.
