## API vs Selenium + requests

For various reasons, I chose not to use the Spotify/Yandex API directly. Instead, Selenium is used for parsing Spotify web pages. Parsing Yandex Music, on the other hand, only requires well-configured HTTP requests. This approach enables anyone to use this app without needing any API keys.

## Installation and Usage

To install this app, clone this repo, create Python venv and install the required packages. You can use either `requirements-base.txt` for essential libraries or `requirements.txt` for all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to obtain cookies for your requests to Yandex Music. You may also find `about_cookies.py` and `.sample_env` useful for that.

If you want to use this app as a Telegram bot, obtain a Telegram bot token, store it in the `.env` file, and then run `tgbot.py`. Alternatively, you can use `spotify_link.py` or `yandexmusic_link.py` for your specific tasks.
